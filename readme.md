# Feature Report Example 
To see the feature report example in action, you'll need:
* A machine that has ArcGIS Pro installed and licensed
* [Python pdkfit](https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit) installed in your python environment
* This repo cloned to your machine, or download as a .zip, and unzipped somewhere on your machine. 


1. Open Jupyter, and upload the "feature_report_example.ipynb" notebook from the repo so you can access the notebook in your IDE (or open it in whatever IDE you're comfortable with that works with ipynb notebooks)

2. Once the notebook is open, in cell 2, change the SSP_offices_path variable to where you cloned the repo

    `SSP_offices_path = r"C:\SSP_offices"`


3. Run all the cells and the pdfs will be generated in the pdfs directory
